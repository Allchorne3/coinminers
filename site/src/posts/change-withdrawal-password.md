1. In Stronghold go to the **My** tab. Click **Settings** and then **Change Withdrawal Address**. There will be 4 inputs. The first input will have your current withdrawal address. This can not be edited. The following 3 can be filled out as follows:
 - **Enter OTP:** Click the **Get OTP** button. This will send a code to the email address you used to setup your Stronghold account.
 - **Enter new withdrawal address:** Paste the USDT withdrawal address you copied from Kraken
 - **Enter payment password:** Enter the payment password you created when creating your Stronghold account

Then press **Submit** and your withdrawal address has been changed.
