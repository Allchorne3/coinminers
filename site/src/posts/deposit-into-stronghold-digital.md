***If you have already got a Kraken account, you can skip to step 3, otherwise, start at step 1***


1. The first thing you will need to do is have a crypto exchange platform, this is a platform where you can buy, sell and convert cryptocurrency. There are very good examples like Binance or Kraken. For this website, we will use Kraken.

2. Register for a new account on Kraken. It is a simple straight forward signup process.

3. Once that step is completed, you need to deposit money into Kraken. To do this, open the Kraken app, press the purple icon at the bottom of the screen and then press **Deposit**.

4. Now select your currency. **Pound Sterling** in this case. 

5. Next is the deposit method. **Link bank account** is the best and most recommended option.

6. Select your bank. Once selected, you will see the deposit screen. Enter the amount you would like to deposit (Remember, this is in your chosen currency) and press **Review**. You will be taken to your online banking app to complete this step. Once you are taken back to Kraken, you need to **Swipe to confirm**.

7. You will need to wait approximately 5 minutes for the balance to show in your Kraken account. If you press the **Portfolio** button, this is where you can see your balance.

8. Once the money is showing in your **Portfolio**, you will need to convert this currency to **Bitcoin**. To do this, press the purple icon at the bottom of the screen and this time, press **Convert**. 

9. You will be brought to the convert screen. You will need to choose your current currency in the **From** section and your target currency in the **To** section. In this case, in the **From** section, choose **Â£GBP** and in the **To** section, choose **USDT** (Tether). The **Order type** should be automatically selected to be **Convert now**.

10. Press **Review** and then **Swipe to confirm**.

11. You now will now have **Tether** in your account.

12. At this stage, you need to go to **Stronghold**. Head to the **My** tab and then select **Deposit**. Now enter the amount you would like to deposit and click **Submit**. On the next screen, you should see a 34 digit wallet address consisting of random numbers and letters and a QR code. This is your Stronghold wallet address. Copy this address. If you are using a computer, then you can make use of the QR code instead, we will come back to that.

13. Now head back into Kraken, press the purple icon and click **Withdraw**. You should see your Tether(USDT) balance, select it. Now enter the amount of Tether you want to withdraw. (You will see a **Max** button above the keypad, to easily select the whole balance).

14. Now click **Withdraw to** and select **Add new address**. You can now paste the Stronghold wallet address or click the small QR code icon which will allow you to scan the QR code that was mentioned earlier. Press **Next**, give it a name, (**Stronghold Deposit** is usually a good choice). Press **Next**, you will see a confirmation of the description and wallet address. Press **Save and continue**. 

15. You will now be back at the withdraw screen with your new Stronghold wallet address automatically selected. Press **Review**, then **Swipe to confirm**.

16. Your Tether is now on its way to your Stronghold account. It is usually in your account within a matter of seconds. Head back to Stronghold and you will see the same screen as before, with the QR Code and the wallet address. Wait for a few seconds and the page will update to confirm the transaction has been completed or similar. The balance will show up within a few seconds (You may have to just refresh the screen).
