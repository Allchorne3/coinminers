***If you have already got a Kraken account, you can skip to step 4, otherwise, start at step 1***


1. The first thing you will need to do is have a crypto exchange platform, this is a platform where you can buy, sell and convert cryptocurrency. There are very good examples like Binance or Kraken. For this website, we will use Kraken.

2. Register for a new account on Kraken. It is a simple straight forward signup process.

3. Once that step is completed, you can start the withdrawal process.

4. In Kraken, press the purple icon at the bottom of the screen and then press **Deposit**.

5. Search for **Bitcoin (BTC)** and select it. 

6. You now have to select the network. This is always **Bitcoin**.

7. You will now see a QR code and below that, a **BTC deposit address**. Copy this address.

8. Now head over to ChainMine and then to **Settings**. You will see a section called **Payout settings** with **Bitcoin address**. Paste the wallet address into there and press **Save**.

9. Head into the **Transfer BTC** section and you should see the wallet address under **Bitcoin receiver address**.

10. You will also see **Withdrawal amount**. Enter the amount you wish to withdraw and then press **Send**. (The minimum withdrawal amount is Â£2.58, which is 0.00012000 BTC).

11. After pressing **Send**, a popup will appear saying something along the lines of "In progress". At the bottom of the page, under **All your payouts**, the **Transaction** column will say **Pending** and the **Status** column will say **In Queue**. After a little bit of time, the **Transaction** column will change to a random set of numbers and letters which is the transaction code and the **Status** will say **Done**.

12. Heading over to Kraken, the withdrawal amount will show as a pending payment. After a little bit of time, the amount will show up in your **Portfolio** page. At the time of creating this guide, it took 1 hour from start to finish.
