***If you have already got a Kraken account, you can skip to step 4, otherwise, start at step 1***


1. The first thing you will need to do is have a crypto exchange platform, this is a platform where you can buy, sell and convert cryptocurrency. There are very good examples like Binance or Kraken. For this website, we will use Kraken.

2. Register for a new account on Kraken. It is a simple straight forward signup process.

3. Once that step is completed, you can start the withdrawal process.

4. In Kraken, press the purple icon at the bottom of the screen and then press **Deposit**.

5. Search for **Tether (USDT)** and select it. 

6. You now have to select the network. Select **Tron**.

7. You will now see a QR code and below that, a **USDT deposit address**. Copy this address.

8. Now head over to Stronghold and go to the **My** tab. Click **Settings** and then **Change Withdrawal Address**. There will be 4 inputs. The first one says **Old withdrawal address (default is empty)**. You can ignore this if you havenâ€™t previously set up a withdrawal address.
Fill the other 3 inputs like so:
 - **Enter OTP:** Click the **Get OTP** button. This will send a code to the email address you used to setup your Stronghold account.
 - **Enter new withdrawal address:** Paste the USDT withdrawal address you copied from Kraken
 - **Enter payment password:** Enter the payment password you created when creating your Stronghold account

Then press **Submit** and your withdrawal address is added.

9. If not already, head back to the **My** tab and click **Withdraw**. Your **Withdrawal address** should automatically be filled in. Enter the amount you wish to withdraw.
**NOTE:** There is a 14% service fee. This is to cover management fees, electricity fees and operating costs. So make sure that you add 14% onto the withdrawal amount if you want to withdraw a specific amount. For example, if you want to withdraw $50 then enter $57 as the withdrawal amount.

10. Enter the **Payment password** you created when creating your Stronghold account.

11. Heading over to Kraken, the withdrawal amount will show as a pending payment. After a little bit of time, the amount will show up in your **Portfolio** page. At the time of creating this guide, it took 1 hour from start to finish.
