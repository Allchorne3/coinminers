1. Visit [https://strongholddigital.net/#/pages/register/register?_c=EHDD3T](https://strongholddigital.net/#/pages/register/register?_c=EHDD3T) to register for an account. This link will automatically add an invitation code (EHDD3T) which is needed to create the account. The registration form is straightforward, however I will outline the steps for each of the form fields:
- **Enter email address**: As it says, enter your email address
- **Enter OTP:** You will see a button that says **Get OTP**, click this button and it will send a code to the email address you entered in the previous field. Add the code to this form field
- **Add your phone number:** Select your country of residence by clicking the flag and enter your phone number without the leading 0.
- **Enter login password:** As it says, enter a password
- **Confirm login password:** Re-enter the password
- **Enter payment password:** Enter a 6 digit number. It is very important the you remember this or take a note of it. This is used when depositing and withdrawing funds and renting mines.
- **Confirm payment password:** Re-enter the 6 digit number.
- **Enter invitational code:** This is the invite code mentioned at the start of this guide (EHDD3T). As previously mentioned, this will automatically be entered when you visited the register link.

You have now created an account.

2. The next step is to rent a mine. To start off, you can rent a mine for free, this will give you a very tiny amount of USDT, however it is a perfect learning tool for renting a mining machine, collecting your earnings and terminating the mining machine.

3. To get started renting a mine, click the **Deal** tab, here you will see a list of mining machines to rent, each costing more and the list goes on. The very first mine you see will be the **Free** mine. You will see a red button that says **Rent Now**. Click it and a popup will appear with an overview of the mine and its price. In this case, the price is **0 USDT**. Click **Pay Now**.

4. You are now renting a mining machine. In the top right corner, you will see **My Mining Machines**. Click it and you will see a list of the machines that you are currently renting.
The machine will show you how much you will be mining per hour. This is called **Hash Power: (USDT/Hour(s))**. The higher the hash power, the more you will earn per hour. You will also see **Produced: (USDT)**, this will show you how much you have earned. This number will updated every hour, so don’t be alarmed if it is still at **0** in 45 minutes time.

5. To increase your earnings, you will need to rent more machines. To do this, you can deposit funds into your account. [This guide here](/posts/deposit-into-stronghold-digital/) will walk you through the process of depositing funds into Stronghold.
